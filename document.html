            <h2>Fifth-generation wireless (5G) is the latest iteration of cellular technology, 
                engineered to greatly increase the speed and responsiveness of wireless networks.
                5G networks and services will be deployed in stages over the next several years to 
                accommodate the increasing reliance on mobile and internet-enabled devices.</h2>

            <h3>What is 5G?</h3>
            <p>5G is the 5th generation mobile network. It is a new global wireless standard after 1G, 
                2G, 3G, and 4G networks. 5G enables a new kind of network that is designed to connect virtually 
                everyone and everything together including machines, objects, and devices.</p><br>
            <p>5G wireless technology is meant to deliver higher multi-Gbps peak data speeds,
                 ultra low latency, more reliability, massive network capacity, increased availability, 
                 and a more uniform user experience to more users. Higher performance and improved efficiency
                 empower new user experiences and connects new industries.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sec2">
            <h3>Who invented 5G?</h3>
            <p>No one company or person owns 5G, but there are several companies within the mobile ecosystem 
                that are contributing to bringing 5G to life. Qualcomm has played a major role in inventing
                 the many foundational technologies that drive the industry forward and make up 5G, the next 
                 wireless standard.</p><br>
            <p>3GPP is driving many essential inventions across all aspects of 5G design, from the air
                 interface to the service layer. Other 3GPP 5G members range from infrastructure vendors
                  and component/device manufacturers to mobile network operators and vertical service
                   providers.</p>

        <section id="sec3">
             <h3>Uses of 5G</h3>
             <p>Broadly speaking, 5G is used across three main types of connected services, including 
                 enhanced mobile broadband, mission-critical communications, and the massive IoT. A defining
                  capability of 5G is that it is designed for forward compatibility—the ability to flexibly 
                  support future services that are unknown today.</p>
             <p><b>Enhanced mobile broadband</b>
                In addition to making our smartphones better, 5G mobile technology can usher in new immersive
                 experiences such as VR and AR with faster, more uniform data rates, lower latency, and lower
                  cost-per-bit.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Mission-critical communications</b>
                5G can enable new services that can transform industries with ultra-reliable, available,
                 low-latency links like remote control of critical infrastructure, vehicles, and medical 
                 procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Massive IoT</b>
                5G is meant to seamlessly connect a massive number of embedded sensors in virtually everything
                 through the ability to scale down in data rates, power, and mobility—providing extremely lean 
                 and low-cost connectivity solutions.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="sec4">
            <h3>How fast is 5G?</h3>
            <p>5G is designed to deliver peak data rates up to 20 Gbps based on IMT-2020 requirements. 
                Qualcomm Technologies’ flagship 5G solutions, the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ X65 is designed to 
                achieve up to 10 Gbps in downlink peak data rates.</p>
            <p>5G can also deliver much lower latency for a more immediate response and can provide an
                 overall more uniform user experience so that the data rates stay consistently high even 
                 when users are moving around. And the new 5G NR mobile network is backed up by a Gigabit 
                 LTE coverage foundation, which can provide ubiquitous Gigabit-class connectivity.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sec5">
            <h3>Is 5G available now?</h3>
            <p>Yes, 5G is already here today, and global operators started launching new 5G networks in early 2019. 
                Also, all major phone manufacturers are commercializing 5G phones. And soon, even more people may be 
                able to access 5G.</p>
            <p>
                5G has been deployed in 60+ countries and counting. We are seeing much faster rollout 
                and adoption compared with 4G. Consumers are very excited about the high speeds and low 
                latencies. But 5G goes beyond these benefits by also providing the capability for 
                mission-critical services, enhanced mobile broadband and massive IoT. While it is hard to 
                predict when everyone will have access to 5G, we are seeing great momentum of 5G launches 
                in its first year and we expect more countries to launch their 5G networks in 2020 and beyond.

            <h3>How does 5G Work?</h3>
            <img src="archi.png" alt="5g architecture">
            <p>A mobile network has two main components, the ‘Radio Access Network’ and the ‘Core Network’.</p>
            <p><b>The Radio Access Network</b> - consists of various types of facilities including small cells, towers, masts and 
                dedicated in-building and home systems that connect mobile users and wireless devices to the main core network.<br>

                Small cells will be a major feature of 5G networks particularly at the new millimetre wave (mmWave) frequencies where
                 the connection range is very short. To provide a continuous connection, small cells will be distributed in clusters depending 
                 on where users require connection which will complement the macro network that provides wide-area coverage.<br>
                
                5G Macro Cells will use MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) antennas that have multiple elements or connections to
                 send and receive more data simultaneously. The benefit to users is that more people can simultaneously connect to the network 
                 and maintain high throughput.  Where MIMO antennas use very large numbers of antenna elements they are often referred 
                 to as ‘massive MIMO’, however, the physical size is similar to existing 3G and 4G base station antennas.</p>
            <p>
                <b>The Core Network</b> - is the mobile exchange and data network that manages all of the mobile voice, data and 
                internet connections. For 5G, the ‘core network’ is being redesigned to better integrate with the internet and cloud 
                based services and also includes distributed servers across the network improving response times (reducing latency).<br>

                Many of the advanced features of 5G including network function virtualization and network slicing for different 
                applications and services, will be managed in the core. The following illustration shows examples of local cloud servers
                 providing faster content to users (movie streaming) and low latency applications for vehicle collision avoidance systems
